# Amiga Blitz Basic 2 Language Support

This extension adds language support for the Amiga version of Blitz Basic 2 (and Amiblitz). The extension is in alpha state so syntax highlighting is still limited.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting.
- Snippets for most Blitz Basic 2 functions and methods.
- Outline shows macros, labels, functions and statements.
- Show help for Blitz Basic 2 functions and methods (requires command line tools, see below).
- Commands for running the app/game in WinUAE or on a real Amiga (requires command line tools, see below).

## Requirements

A few command line tools are needed to enable all the features, I will add more information about those later.

## Known Issues
